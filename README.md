# Migrating Role-based Access Control (RBAC) to Policy-based Access Control (PBAC)

This repository demonstrates how to migrate application access control from a traditional Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) approach to a modern Policy-Based Access Control (PBAC) implementation using AWS Verified Permissions.

## Overview

Access control is a critical component of application security. This project showcases a practical migration path from RBAC to PBAC using a sample Pet Store application. The repository contains two implementations of the same application:

- **rbac-pet-store-app**: Traditional implementation using Role-Based Access Control
- **pbac-pet-store-app**: Modern implementation using Policy-Based Access Control

## About the Application

Wyld Pet Store is an online pet management application where users can view all available pets and store admin can add, and manage pets. The application demonstrates how access control affects user permissions for different operations within the store.

## Getting Started

### For Traditional RBAC Implementation
Navigate to the `rbac-pet-store-app` directory and follow the instructions in its README.md file.

### For PBAC Implementation
Navigate to the `pbac-pet-store-app` directory (coming soon) and follow the instructions in its README.md file.

## Migration Path

This repository demonstrates how, with a few simple steps, you can transform your application's access control from RBAC to PBAC, making it more secure, flexible, and easier to manage.

Follow both implementations to understand the key differences and benefits of moving to a policy-based approach.
